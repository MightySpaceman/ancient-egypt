    <p>From the time that it started to form, until it’s eventual demise multiple thousands of years later, 
      the Ancient Egyptian civilization was one of the greatest and most accomplished in history.
       You could even argue that they were more powerful than the roman civilization – after all, they were 
       around for much longer and brought a handful of useful technologies into our world. Paper and toothpaste, 
       to name a couple well-known ones. Even the Greeks looked up to the Egyptians – many Greek buildings have 
       been found inscribed with Egyptian-esque artwork, as if they were honoring their neighbor’s culture and society.</p>

    <p>
      But such an honorable society did did not come by itself. It began with one of the most essential components of society: 
      order.

            The Northern wall of king Tutankhamun’s Tomb, shown here, 
            is just one part of the story formed by the surrounding 
            murals. They show the process of Tutankhamun’s funeral 
            and transition to the afterlife – funeral procession, 
            entrance to the underworld, and arrival in the afterlife 
            for the East, South, and North walls respectively. 
            
            <br><br>

            The West wall has excerpts from the Amduat, an ancient funerary 
            text, which describes the journey of the sun god Ra over 
            the course of the day.

      <h2>The Egyptian Heirarchy</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient Egyptian civilization was composed of a set of distinct rankings, 
        which most people fell into quite neatly. It can be split into two main 
        sections: the officials and the commoners. The officials worked or
         collaborated with the government itself in some way or another, while 
         the commoners made a living by other means, usually through trade between 
         each other. From these sections came the more specific rankings. In order 
         from most powerful to least powerful, they consisted of:

        <p>
          Neferneferuaten Nefertiti, commonly shortened to simply ‘Nefertiti’ 
          was one of the 7 known queens of ancient Egypt. The first wife to the 
          famous Ramesses II (or ‘Ramses’), and later King Akhenaten,  she lived
          between around 1370 – 1330 B.C.E. Nefertiti is well known for 
          collaborating with Akhenaten to introduce a new age of Egyptian 
          religion, in which a singular sun god, ‘Aton’ was worshipped – instead 
          of the ~1,500 previous gods of Egyptian culture.

      <h3>Pharoahs</h3>
      <p>
        Pharaohs were at the very top of the social hierarchy and were responsible 
        for all major decisions. Even more important, they oversaw all religious 
        ceremonies and practices – Pharaohs themselves were regarded as demigods, 
        half human and half divine being.

      <h3>Priests</h3>
      <p>Priests were second in charge for religious activities. Their main objective 
        was to earn the satisfaction and respect of the gods, through daily rituals, 
        usually within specifically allocated temples. Alongside that, they were also 
        a major part in preparing the deceased for mummification. Egyptian priests 
        almost always had shaved heads and white clothes.
      </p>

      <h3>Soldiers</h3>
      <p>
        The job of an Egyptian soldier is pretty self-explanatory. They fought in battles 
        and defended the empire. They trained in a variety of weapons – from swords to bows – 
        and the best were narrowed down based on their skills. When not directly on duty, 
        they also worked on laborious tasks such as the construction of structures and the 
        harvest of crops.

      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
          A Ushabti figures, or ‘Shabti’ figures are small model representations of people with 
          recitable verses inscribed onto them. They are usually used within burial or funerary 
          rituals and are commonly found within most Egyptian tombs.
          <br><br>
          The figure shown here was excavated around the year 1900 in Abydos, upper Egypt, 
          and is currently owned by the McLean Museum and Art Gallery in Scotland. It has 
          dimensions of approximately 4cm x 15cm.

          Mitri was a supervisor of scribes, and scribe himself, who lived in Egypt’s late 5th – early 6th dynasty around 4500 years ago.
          <br><br>
          The statue here is made of surprisingly pristine wood, with highlights in stone and copper. It was found in Mitri’s tomb in the year 1926, 
          and is currently on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.

      <h3>Scribes</h3>
      <p>Scribes were the only people who knew how to read or write in ancient Egypt. 
        Many years of learning were required to earn the skill – and for that reason, 
        it became a dedicated role in the empire. Doctors would also have to learn to 
        become a scribe in order to read medical texts, adding on another few years of 
        study. Papyrus, the predecessor to paper, was the medium of choice for writing 
        on; with a ‘pen’ - which was actually a brush - dipped in ink used to produce 
        markings.
      </p>

      <h3>Merchants</h3>
      <p>
        Merchants were like the veins of Egypt, supporting the economy as a bridge 
        between buyer and seller. They transported assorted goods around the empire 
        itself and its surroundings; from pottery, to wheat, to gold, to fabric. Without them, 
        ancient Egypt may not have been as successful as we know it was.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="standard" id="paragraph6">
      <hr>
      <h3>Artisans</h3>
      <p>Artisans were amazing craftsmen and artists. They produced all of the beautiful 
        stone sculptures and wall murals that we admire today - all the fine, detailed work 
        inside the many architectural wonders of Egypt were done by them. Sculpting and  
        wall art were not the only things they did, though; an ancient Egyptian artisan 
        could have been anything from a scribe, to a carpenter, to a carver. It's less of 
        a specific job title, and more of a collective group of professions.
      </p>

      <h3>Farmers</h3>
      <p>
        Probably the most common people in Egypt were farmers. They were just regular commoners; 
        cultivating, sowing, maintaining and harvesting crops year round – either to sell at markets 
        or feed themselves and their families. Egyptian crops were very similar to what we see today – barley, 
        wheat, beans, lentils, cabbage and so on.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="standard" id="paragraph7">
      <hr>
      <h3>Slaves</h3>
      <p>Slaves did much of the dirty work in the ancient world. They attended to pharaohs and important people, 
        and were considered a sign of great power. living conditions weren't the best, and obviously, you 
        would not want to be a slave in Egypt – or anywhere for that matter. 
        However, in comparison to slavery in other civilizations, it wasn’t that bad; they were still allowed to 
        do many of the things a normal person could (including owning property), apart from the fact that they 
        were forced into labour.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="standard" id="paragraph8">
      <hr>
      <h3>What environmental and situational factors contributed to the rise of the ancient Egyptian empire?</h3>
      <p>
        You might think that Africa would be an unlikely place for a large, powerful civilization to develop – after all, 
        most of it is dry, grassy Savannah or sandy desert stretching for thousands of kilometres. But Egypt is an interesting 
        place.
        <br><br>
        The Egyptian empire was birthed and supported by the life-giving Nile river. That’s the reason it existed – one of 
        the longest rivers in the world, it stretches from all the way down in Uganda and up through Egypt, until it reaches 
        the Mediterranean sea in the uppermost parts of the territory; spanning over 6,600 kilometres, it passes through 
        multiple other countries along the way.
        <br><br>
        The Nile provided, and still does provide precious water for drinking and irrigating crops. Around its banks is where 
        you see most of the Ancient Egyptian wonders and relics – and even today, the majority of major Egyptian cities are 
        situated around it. Even over thousands of years, the Nile has persisted, bringing life and civilization with it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="standard" id="paragraph8">
      <hr>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The Ancient Egyptians were amazing people. They built structures that are remarkable even today; 
        they had art, maths and science. They had social structure. They were so advanced that you could 
        even go as far as to say that if they had an industrial revolution, they could have ended up at a 
        technological level like we are at right now – thousands of years ago.
